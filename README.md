# codeclause-task2
This project includes the designing of an alarm clock using GUI in python. There are certain libraries/modules used, which needed to be installed. Those libraries are tkinter, datetime and playsound.Then i defined a function named alarm and wrote the desired condition under the function with all the conditions written.On running the code a window will open named alarm clock. One thing we should keep in mind to define that the time should be in 24-hours format. Then we can set the alarm time and the timme will start displaying in the run terminal,once the desired time will reach the alarm will play the sound until and unless we close the alarm.
It was a bit difficult to design this program as there were so many different libraries used in this,but i learnt so much from this project. I hope this description and my code would be easier to understand.
